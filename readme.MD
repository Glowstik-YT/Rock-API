### What is Rock API?
Rock API is an API that allows you to view rocks and find the ratings on them. However, this isn't a regular "rock finding" API... We have rocks like, `crunchy rock`, `falling rock`, and MANY more. This api we made for entertainment purposes. Use this API in your Discord bot for commands like `pls rock` or `!randomrock`. Use it in your website for... something.
