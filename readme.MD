# Rock API 
#### The best Rock API


### What is Rock API?
Rock API is an api that allows you to view rocks and get the ratings on them. I have a Discord bot which allows you to rate.


### How do I use Rock API?

URL = `https://mrconos.pythonanywhere.com/rock/<rock name>` - Gives you a rock which returns a name, desc, image (link or none), and rating. The rating is supposed to be out of 5.
