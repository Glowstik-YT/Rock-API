# Rock API 
#### The best Rock API


### What is Rock API?
Rock API is an api that allows you to view rocks and get the ratings on them. I have a Discord bot which allows you to rate. This is honestly a stupid idea and I don't plan on making anything official. 


### How do I use Rock API?

Honestly, just read the files under the test folder.
